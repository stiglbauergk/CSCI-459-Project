## Title: Using Django based Web Application  
### Status: ACCEPTED 
### Context: A Web application is necessary to fulfill the requirements of the assignment.
* The benefits of using Django 
  * Django was made with the intention of creating web applications quickly and efficiently 
  * Django applications are scalable
  * Django itself is very versatile 
  * Django is Python-based thus it is quick to learn, fast to write and very readable.
  * Django offers a way to perform raw SQL queries with Manager.raw() 
  * Django is popular and could land us jobs. 
 ### Consequences: This is a new language for the team, so there may be a learning curve. However, there is a lot of documentation out there for DJango because it is so popular. 

### Updates:
### 4/9/2018 (Sprint 2):
The app has been built with CRUD operations. The app can be scaled from here, but currently has good functionality. The next step is to Dockerize the app and also work on its visual appeal.
